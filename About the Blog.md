If you are here to learn about me and see what I can do, you have drifted too far! That info is back on my main page, [huntercaron.com](http://huntercaron.com/)

This is my blog where I will write about anything from me wondering, new things in the design, and maybe even a tutorial if I am feeling abitious. It is extremely casual so don't be expecting to much! It's made to have a maximum idea per minute rate.

If you are okay with all this, then dig in! I hope you enjoy yourself.
